# Google Assistant Action

Google Assistant is Googleâ€™s virtual personal assistant and uses Actions on Google as the platform for "Actions" (software applications) to extend the functionality of the Google Assistant. Users engage Google Assistant in conversation to get things done, like controlling their devices and things at home. You can use the officially certified openHAB Action for Google Assistant to easily manage and control your smart home by conversational experiences between you and your openHAB smart home powered by voiced commands.

This guide describes step by step how to use the [openHAB Google Assistant Smart Home Action](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000f5c61c627e?hl=en-US&source=web). The openHAB Action links your openHAB setup through the [myopenHAB.org](https://www.myopenhab.org) cloud service to the Google Assistant platform (for technical insights, please refer to this [guide](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-google-assistant/blob/master/README.md) to read more about setup options and development information).

With the Action you can voice control your openHAB items and it supports lights, plugs, switches and thermostats. The openHAB Action comes with multiple language support like English, German or French language.

# General Configuration Instructions

## Requirements

* [openHAB Cloud Connector](http://docs.openhab.org/addons/ios/openhabcloud/readme.html) configured using myopenHAB.org
* Google account
* Google Home or Google Home mini 

## Item configuration
* In openHAB 2 Items are exposed via Homekit tags, the following is taken from the homekit binding in openHAB2:

  ```
  Switch KitchenLights "Kitchen Lights" <light> (gKitchen) [ "Lighting" ]
  Dimmer BedroomLights "Bedroom Lights" <light> (gBedroom) [ "Lighting" ]
  
  //Standalone Thermostat Sensor (just reports current ambient temperature)
  Number HK_SF_Bedroom_Temp "Bedroom Temperature [%.1f]" [ "CurrentTemperature", "Fahrenheit"]
  
  //Thermostat Setup (Google requires a mode, even if you manually set it up in Openhab)
  Group g_HK_Basement_TSTAT "Basement Thermostat" [ "Thermostat", "Fahrenheit" ]
  Number HK_Basement_Mode "Basement Heating/Cooling Mode" (g_HK_Basement_TSTAT) [ "homekit:HeatingCoolingMode" ]
  Number HK_Basement_Temp	"Basement Temperature" (g_HK_Basement_TSTAT) [ "CurrentTemperature" ]
  Number HK_Basement_Setpoint "Basement Setpoint" (g_HK_Basement_TSTAT) [ "TargetTemperature" ]
  ```

Currently the follwoing Tags are supported (also depending on Googles API capabilities):
* ["Lighting"]
* ["Switchable"]
* ["CurrentTemperature"]
* ["Thermostat"] 

Notes Regarding Thermostat Items:
- Thermostat requires a group to be properly setup with Google Assistant, default format is Celsius
- There must be 3 elements:
  * Mode: May be Number (Zwave THERMOSTAT_MODE Format) or String (off, heat, cool, on)
  * Current Temperature: Number
  * TargetTemperature: Number
- If your thermostat does not have a mode, you should create one and manually assign a value (e.g. heat, cool, on, etc.) to have proper functionality
- See also HomeKit Addon for further formatting details
